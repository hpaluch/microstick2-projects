# Blinkding LED for PIC24FJ and Microstick II

Here is introductory blinking LED demo for:
* [Microstick II][Microstick II]  board
* [PIC24FJ64GB002][PIC24FJ64GB002]  (included with *my* Microstick II, may
  or not be included with yours...)

What it does:
* blinking LED on board at 1 Hz using Timer1 and Interrupt
* generated with MCC tool  

I plan to use it as template for
project [../pic24hj-blink.X/](../pic24hj-blink.X/) 
where MCC tool is not supported.

* MPLAB X IDE v6.05
* DFP 1.8.217
* MCC Plugin v5.2.2
* XC16 v2.0
